                  p Autism affects about 1 in 59 children, an increase from 1 in 68 two years ago, according to the latest data recently released by the Centers for Disease Control, meaning that 2.3% of the U.S. population has autism. These numbers will likely increase as individuals in underserved markets are better identified, with prevalence rates expected to increase at 10-17% per year.
                  p Because of this growing autism epidemic, demand for services is increasing exponentially resulting in intense investor interest in this sector. Autism services cost U.S. citizens approximately $250 Billion annually, with the individual lifetime cost per person ranging from $1.4million to $3.2million depending on the intellectual capacity of each individual. 
                  p Currently, the autism services / therapeutic market in the U.S. is estimated to be valued at $2Billion dollars and growing at a rate of 4% per year. This includes programs that serve individuals with autism as well as drugs targeted behavioral issues in autism. 
                  b This summit will provide participants with valuable insights on the outlook for financial investment in the autism healthcare industry.​ ​Our first-annual all-day “Autism Investor Summit” falls on February 12, 2019 in Los Angeles, CA.

              | Opportunity
              span Investors are in a strong position to consolidate, expand, and create the kinds of economies of scale that are common in other sectors of healthcare, and in other industries.​ The autism service market is a highly fragmented marketplace with many opportunities for consolidation, favorable returns on investment and the elevation of regulation and oversight of care.
                br
                | Because autism treatment is a fairly new field, the industry lacks regulation and oversight. While this is a challenge when evaluating the quality of treatment centers, it’s also an opportunity to implement cutting-edge treatments and technologies. Despite concerns about how modifications to the Affordable Care Act (aka the “ACA” or “Obama Care”) has affected coverage of autism treatment services, from a long-term perspective, the sector is poised for long-term growth.

                    b EXPANDED FUNDING
                    p Historically, autism has been chronically underserved, and this lack of intervention and necessary services continues in many communities today. Expanded state and federal coverage of autism treatment and increased private insurance coverage for ABA therapy is leading to the expansion of services and an increased interest by investors in this sector of the market.

                    b INTERVENTION
                    p Autism treatment using Applied Behavior Analysis is one of the few areas that attracts bipartisan political support,​ and still, the autism epidemic shows few signs of diminishing​.

                    b DEMAND
                    p More families are seeking care for their child because the social stigma of autism, developmental delay, and a formal diagnosis is dissipating.

                    b PROVIDERS
                    p  In smaller communities, the shortage of providers is especially acute. Other than a handful of large providers, such as PE-backed Trumpet Behavioral Health, CARD, Aveanna (previously Epic), Autism Learning Partners, and LEARN Behavioral, providers are mostly very small to medium-sized businesses resulting in a highly fragmented autism services provider market. ​The nine largest ABA therapy companies generate less than a third of the total industry revenue​.
